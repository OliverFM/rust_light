# `rust_light`
A tensor processing library in rust.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to get a simple tensor processing library working.
0. Get something that works.
1. Learn more about rust.
2. Pybind `rust_light`
3. Get `rust_light` to work on a GPU.

### Intended functionality:
1. implement a `Tensor` that supports multiplication and additions -- for scalars and matrices/tensors.
2. Enable full `numpy`-style [broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html).
3. stretch: add some kind of auto-grad.
